ADAassign1
==========
This assignment was for Algorithms Design and Analysis paper.
Ximei was the QA for the implementation.
In the assignment, we practiced different methods for generating fibonacci numbers. We analyzed asymptotic time complexity.
It is an example to show why we need to design better algorithms.
